# GReX_setup
The setup and installation of the server software for the TCD GReX which is to be placed in Birr.

This mostly follows the instructions set out [here](https://grex-telescope.github.io/software/server_setup/), with a few exceptions. The installation instructions can be found in [Instructions.md](https://github.com/ismisebrendan/GReX_setup/blob/main/Instructions.md).

[Troubleshooting.md](https://github.com/ismisebrendan/GReX_setup/blob/main/Troubleshooting.md) contains details of the troubleshooting that was done to work out the problems encountered when setting up the GReX.

Thank you to David McKenna and Joe McCauley for helping me with this and debugging the many many errors that I ran into.
