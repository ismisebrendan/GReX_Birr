# GReX_setup
The installation of the server software for the TCD GReX which is to be placed in Birr

This mostly follows the instructions set out [here](https://grex-telescope.github.io/software/server_setup/), with a few exceptions.

Thank you to David McKenna for helping me with this and debugging the many many errors that I ran into.
