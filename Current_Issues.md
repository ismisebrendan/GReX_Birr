# The current problems with the GReX setup

Automatic plotting and reporting of candidates using T3 is not working. What I have done so far, written as instructions is shown below. I imagine it's a case of some dependencies or something not working, but there isn't much about T3 out there and I've not been able to get much from the GReX team about it.

In ```~/grex/``` make a new directory ```t3/``` and in here run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GReX-Telescope/GReX-T3
```

Within this directory go to ```GReX-T3/grex_t3/``` and edit ```T3_monitor.py```. Here you should replace

```sh
logfile = '/home/user/zghuai/GReX-T3/services/T3_plotter.log'
env_dir = "/home/user/zghuai/GReX-T3/grex_t3/"
mon_dir = "/hdd/data/voltages/" # monitoring dir
dir_plot = "/hdd/data/candidates/T3/candplots/" # place to save output plots
dir_fil  = "/hdd/data/candidates/T3/candfils/"  # place to save output filterbank files
```

Also modify ```T3_manager.py``` and replace

```sh
FILPATH = '/home/liam/grexdata/'
OUTPUT_PATH = '/home/liam/grexdata/output'
```

with the appropriate paths for your set-up (although it is probably easiest if you leave the third to fifth lines in the first block as they are).

Then copy the files ```~/grex/t3/GReX-T3/services/cand_plotter.service``` and ```~/grex/t3/GReX-T3/services/clear_disks.service``` to ```/etc/systemd/system/``` and in them change the lines pointing to directories to correspond to your own system.

Within ```~/grex/t3/GReX-T3``` run

```sh
poetry install
```


The pipeline can be run by running ```~/grex/pipeline/grex.sh```.
